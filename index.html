  <!-- about -->
  <section>
    <p>In 2019 I've decided to change my career. I wanted to feel that I am a part of something
      meaningful, that with my work I make a positive impact on the world. Considering myself as a
      caring, mindful and environmentally-conscious person who has always been keen on technology
      has put me naturally on a path to follow 'tech for good' ethos. With programming's virtually unlimited possibilities I've made the transition into coding. That's why and how I've become an alumn of the renowned software development
      boot camp - <a href="https://makers.tech">Makers Academy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Community Video</h2>
    <p>This project was completed remotely.

      We were given 7 days of feature building along with 1 day of cleaning up and then 1 day for presentations.

      Our goal was to create a website that allowed creative people to post free tutorials on whatever they would like to share.

      As a user you have the option to follow, like and even donate to that creator. You also have your own profile to share and upload your own videos should you wish. As well as have a home page that contains the latest videos relevant to you; the
      specific user.

      This project was inspired by the CO-VID 19 outbreak where most of the world had to respect social distancing and have most of their lives occur in the online world.</p>
