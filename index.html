  <!-- about -->
  <section>
    <p>In 2019 I've decided to change my career. I wanted to feel that I am a part of something
      meaningful, that with my work I make a positive impact on the world. Considering myself as a
      caring, mindful and environmentally-conscious person who has always been keen on technology
      has put me naturally on a path to follow 'tech for good' ethos. With programming's virtually unlimited possibilities I've made the transition into coding. That's why and how I've become an alumn of the renowned software development
      boot camp - Makers Academy.</p>
